This post is part of the series of [Practical Malware Analysis Exercises.](../index.md)

This one has a reverse backdoor that starts an invisible console, and attaches a connected socket to stdin, stdout and stderr. Attacker just has to run netcat on the remote host, wait for connections, and has a console waiting. To protect itself, the malware verifies its filename and XOR decodes the URL.

## 1) What strings are statically in the binary?

Nothing obvious. Just DLL and function names.

<!--more-->

## 2) What happens when binary is run?

Creates a bidirectional backdoor out of `cmd.exe` and a socket.
	
- No registry changes.
- No references to argc or argv. No command line parameters.
  1. Verifies name=`ocl.exe`
  2. Decodes a URL with predefined XOR array.
  3. DNS query of domain `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
  4. `gethostbyname` returns `hostent` structure. IP address can be found at `hostent+0x1C` (28 bytes in).
  5. Tries to connect to `practicalmalwareanalysis.com:9999/tcp`


## 3) How can malicious payload be deployed?

Rename file to `ocl.exe`.


## 4) What is happening at `401133`?

Assigns a character array, one byte at a time: `1qaz2wsz3edc`


## 5) What arguments are being passed to `401089`?

  1. arg1 = A scrambled source string, `1qaz2wsz3edc`
  2. arg2 = An array of 32 integers.


## 6) What domain name does this malware use?

`www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com`


## 7) What coding routine is being used to obfuscate the domain name?

XOR against predefined 32 byte array with wrapping (modulo).

```text
for( c=0; c<32; c++)
  result[c] = xor_byte[c] XOR src_byte[c%str_len]
```


## 8) What significance is the `CreateProcessA` call at `40106E`?

Starts an instance of `cmd.exe` with the connected socket as standard input/output/error.
