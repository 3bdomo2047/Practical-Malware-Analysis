## 1) What happens when you run Lab16-02 from the command line?

The console displays the following output:

```powershell
Q:\>Lab16-02.exe
usage: Lab16-02.exe <4 character password>
```

<!--more-->

## 2) What happens when you run Lab16-02 and guess the command-line parameter?

The console displays the following output:

```powershell
Q:\>Lab16-02.exe abcd
Incorrect password, Try again.
```

## 3) What is the command-line password?

From the strings output alone, it looks like `p@ss` is the password, but it was a decoy. The password was found to be `byrr`.


## 4) Load Lab16-02 into IDA Pro. Where in the main function is strncmp found?

The call to [strncmp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eywx8zcx.aspx) in main is found at 40123A, within the _.tls_ section. It compares the command line argument with a string at 408030.

Looking at the the data at 408030 shows that it is four bytes plus the `p@ss` string. Only the first four bytes are compared, so `p@ss` can be ignored.

## 5) What happens when you load this malware into OllyDbg using the default settings?

The program automatically terminates at 7C90EB94 before any analysis can occur.


## 6) What is unique about the PE structure of Lab16-02?

There is a `.tls` section, indicative of anti-debugging functionality.

## 7) Where is the callback located? (Hint: Use `CTRL-E` in IDA Pro.)


The callback is located at 401060.

## 8) Which anti-debugging technique is the program using to terminate immediately in the debugger and how can you avoid this check?


The program has a debugger check that executes in a [TLS callback](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/How+Malware+Defends+Itself+Using+TLS+Callback+Functions/6655), before main(). Having the debugger start at the TLS callback and patching the jumps appeared to be the quickest and easiest way of bypassing these checks.

The check looks for an active window class `OLLYDBG` with a call to [FindWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633499%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) at 401070. The conditional jump at 401078 was inverted from JZ to JNZ, so the branch was always followed.

## 9) What is the command-line password you see in the debugger after you disable the anti-debugging technique?


The user-supplied password is compared by `strncmp` to a string at 408030. After patching the jumps and setting a breakpoint on `strncmp`, the password string is shown to be `bzqr`.

## 10) Does the password found in the debugger work on the command line?


No. The string `bzqr` doesn't work.


## 11) Which anti-debugging techniques account for the different passwords in the debugger and on the command line, and how can you protect against them?


The result of a [OutputDebugString](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363362%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) call, and the value of the BeingDebugged flag, were used in password decoding instructions. Patching instructions was a simple and effective means of defeating the protections.

Looking deeper into the TLS callback shows a second debugger check that looks for a changed error code after the call to OutputDebugString at 40103A. If no debugger is present, a new error should overwrite the existing value. Otherwise the global variable at 40A968 would be incremented.

Cross-referencing the global variable shows that it is used in the password generation thread at 40109B to calculate values. Since this variable is incremented only when a debugger is detected, the increment instruction should be patched so that the variable remains constant.


![Lab16-02_outputdebug](../images/lab16-02_outputdebug.png)


Another part of the password generation mechanism uses the BeingDebugged flag to compute values. BeingDebugged would be set to 0 if no debugger is present. The assignment of BeingDebugged was patched to always assign 0, in the generation function at 40118B.


![Lab16-02_beingdebugged](../images/lab16-02_beingdebugged.png)


With the patches applied, the breakpoint on strncmp showed the password to be `byrr` which worked on the command line.


![Lab16-02_pass1](../images/lab16-02_pass1.png)


Alternatively, a hex editor was used to fill the TLS table in the PE header with zeros at offset 19C, to make the TLS RVA and size 0. Additionally, the instruction to get `BeingDebugged` at offset 118B was patched to get zero instead. This crippled the TLS calls and ignored the BeingDebugged flag, bypassing all anti-debugging measures.
