  2. **Registry key**: `CurrentVersion\Run\Malware` : `C:\Temp\cc.exe`


## 6) Purpose of the malware?

Administer a malware infection. Provide updates/persistence.

Checks for an internet connection, gets a remote command, and executes it. Command is

Based on that command, it can:

- Install the malware to run at boot.
- Copy a new version of the malware.
- Delete the malware.
