## 1) How does this program ensure persistence?

Hijacking the import table of all executables on the system, forcing them to load a 
malicious DLL whenever run.

## 2) Host indicators?
	
- **File**: `kerne132.dll`
- **Mutex**: `SADFHUHF`


## 3) Purpose of the program?

Backdoor for running programs on the command line.

**The EXE:**
	
  1. Copies DLL to bogus `kerne132.dll`.
  2. Goes through file system looking for `.exe` files.
  3. Loads exe file into RAM.
  4. Looks at PE headers, and import tables for `kernel32.dll`
  5. Overwrites `kernel32.dll` with `kerne132.dll` in import table.


**The DLL:**
	
1. DLL checks mutex: `SADFHUHF`
2. DLL creates socket: `127.26.152.13:80/tcp`
3. DLL tries to connect to server and send `hello` command.
4. DLL gets `sleep`, `exec`, or `q` command.
  - `sleep` sleep 6 min
  - `exec` create process
  - `q` quit


## 4) How could this program be removed?

Good luck. Wipe/reinstall, or write an "undo" program.
