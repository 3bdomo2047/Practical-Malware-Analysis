This post is part of the series of [Practical Malware Analysis Exercises.](../index.md)


## 1) How can you get the malware to install itself?

Patch the password or decode the correct one.
	
  1. Pass `-in <password>` for installation.
  2. The file will be copied to System32, cloning kernel32's timestamp.
  3. A service will be created pointing to the new exe.
  4. A registry key will be created, presumably with configuration info.
  5. Service will start on next reboot.

## 2) What are the command line options? What is the password requirement?
	
- `-in <1>`: Create service, create registry key, copy file, modify timestamp.
- `-re <1>`: Uninstall service, delete file.
- `-cÂ  <4>`: Update configuration. Create registry key if not there.
- `-cc <0>`: Print configuration:`k:<aa> h:<bb> p:<cc> per:<dd>`
  - `k=ups`
  - `h=host:http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
  - `p=port:80`
  - `per=60`


## 3) How can you patch this program in Olly to remove password requirement.

Change conditional jump to an unconditional jump at `00402B61`.


## 4) Host based indicators?
	
  1. **Registry key**:`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft \XPS`
  2. **File**: exe in system32 with kernel32 timestamp, and a service named after it.


## 5) What actions can this malware be instructed to take over the network?
	
  1. **SLEEP**: sleep X seconds.
  2. **UPLOAD**: upload file to host.
  3. **DOWNLOAD**: download file from host.
  4. **CMD**: run command on the host.
  5. **NOTHING**

Since it can run commands, it can update and remove remotely.

When the service starts:
	
1. DNS query: `www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
2. Connect over port 80.
3. GET requests: different strings each time, same format
  - `HjD2/eMH7.stT`
  - `SCAL/fD8H.bSS`
  - `8A0y/RwoX.laU`

When sending a request, it calls time functions. May be used for mangling.


## 6) Network based signatures?
	
  1. **URL**: `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
