## 2) Packed/Obfuscated?

This is packed. The only imports are `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`, the PE sections are 
nameless, the virtual size of sections are much larger than the disk size, and PEiD 
identified the packer as FSG 1.0.

Found manual processes for unpacking FSG 1.0, and references to "EP tricks." It's 
possible with more work.

**PEiD**: FSG v1.00 (Eng) -> dulek/xt

FSG 1.0 unpacking:

## 3) Import Hints?

The only visible imports are used for unpacking.

KERNEL32.DLL

1. LoadLibraryA
2. GetProcAddress


## 4) Host/Network Based Indicators?

Can't find anything useful.

Strings analysis shows OLE related contents.

```text
0000000011C5   0000004041C5      0   ole32.vd
0000000011F4   0000004041F4      0   }OLEAUTLA
```

OLEAUT32.DLL is for OLE technologies. Header hashes? Can't get much more than that without going deeper.
