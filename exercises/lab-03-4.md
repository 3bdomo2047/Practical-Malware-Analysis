## 1) What happens when file is run?

The program seemingly did nothing, then spawned a _cmd.exe_ instance to delete itself on disk.

- ProcExp: Nothing interesting.
- RegShot: No registry modifications.
- WireShark: No unusual activity.
- ProcMon: 1783 events for process name `Lab03-04.exe`
- Created a process at the end to delete itself with the string:

`"C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe" /c del C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\Desktop\Lab03-04.exe >> NUL`

## Â 2) What is causing roadblock in dynamic analysis?

The program deletes itself from the hard drive. Presumably, it's failing an environment check or missing an argument.


## 3) What other way can the program be run?

With varying arguments.
In a debugger.
