## 1) Imports and Strings?

No suggestive imports. Only import is `Kernel32.ExitProcess`.

String hints:

1. Some strings are suggestive of other libraries being used (`ws2_32`, `ntdll`, `user32`, `advapi32`).
2. The `advapi32` and registry key strings indicate registry modifications.
3. The `CurrentVersion\Run` registry key indicates that something new will start with Windows.
4. The string `vmx32to64.exe` points to a possible malicious executable.
5. A URL there is a possibly used for exfiltration, downloads, or calling home.

## 2) Host Based Indicators?

- File: *C:\WINDOWS\System32\vmx32to64.exe* (`d537acb8f56a1ce206bc35cf8ff959c0`)
- Registry Key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\VideoDriver`


Copied itself to system32 as `vmx32to64.exe`. Hashes match (`d537acb8f56a1ce206bc35cf8ff959c0`).
Created a registry entry in `CurrentVersion\Run` for the created file, so it starts at boot.


## 3) Network Based Indicators?

- URL: `www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com`

Regular DNS queries to `www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com.` Once responded, repeatedly
tries to connect via `443/tcp` (https). inetsim says that it is receiving an unknown
protocol. Custom authored?
