## 1) What do you notice in Process Explorer?

When the lab is executed, it spawned a svchost.exe process, and a file called 
`practicalmalwareanalysis.log` was created in the working directory. The the 
original program terminated, but svchost.exe stayed. Image properties list 
`Lab03-03.exe` as the parent process, and the working directory as it's current 
directory.

Watching performance graph for `svchost.exe`, disk I/O spikes during typing.

Only file handles are to the working directory and a device, `\Device\KsecDD`. If 
`svchost.exe` is writing to a file through the device, Process Explorer won't see it.


## 2) Can you identify any live memory modifications?

Looking at svchost's properties in Process Explorer allows you to compare the 
strings of the image on disk and in memory, and identify discrepencies.

Not only are the strings in the virtual instance of svchost.exe different (indicating 
runtime changes), but they are very suggestive of a keylogger. `SetWindowsHookExA`, 
`practicalmalwareanalysis.log`, and`[CAPS LOCK]`in particular.

## 3) Host based indicators?

- An instance of svchost.exe with no services, a non-`services.exe` parent, and a 
  non-`System32` working directory.
- A text file named `practicalmalwareanalysis.log`, containing strings that match 
  those found in the malicious svchost.exe.


## 4) Purpose of the program?

This program is a very obvious local keylogger that gets elevated privilege via 
process replacement of svchost.exe, which runs with `SYSTEM` privileges. Guessing 
that it uses hooking to capture keystrokes, and logs to disk through the device 
`\Device\KsecDD`,` making it harder to detect.
