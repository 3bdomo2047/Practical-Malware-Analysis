## 1) How does this program ensure persistence?

Service `malservice` set to auto start at boot.

<!--more-->

## 2) Why does this program use a mutex?

So that it doesn't create and start the service twice.


## 3) Good host-based signature?
	
  1. **Service**: `Malservice`
  2. **Mutex**: `HG345`


## 4) Good network-based signature?

  1. **URL**: `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`


## 5) Purpose of the program?

Installs a DDoS service with 20 threads attacks `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` 
in the year 2100.

Connects to `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` in infinite loop.
Leaves a mutex open to let other instances know it's running.

Program starts a service dispatcher, allowing `malservice` to execute in this process. Calls 
[ServiceMain](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685984%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

Installation:
	
  1. if( mutex `HGL345` is unavailable): exit process
  2. Open mutex `HGL345`
  3. Open connection to service manager.
  4. Create auto start service `malservice` with path to current exe.

Initialization:
	
  1. Create waitable timer: goes off once, in year 2100.
  2. Wait for timer to complete: ms=INFINITE or year=2100.

Create 20 threads that:
	
  1. Open Internet connection with UserAgent=`Internet Explorer 8.0`
  2. Get non-cached handle to `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com`


## 6) When will the program finish execution?

Never
